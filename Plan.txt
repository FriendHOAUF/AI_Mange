You have two project styles you dream about:
1. Novel to Manga Images (📝 ➔ 🎨)
Example: "My Daughter is a Music Genius"
Plan:
The novel is already written.
You pick text (like a paragraph or scene).
The AI makes matching manga-style images from that text.
This way, the story stays the same — you only create the manga art.

2. Text ➔ New Manga Story ➔ Manga Images (✏️ ➔ 📖 ➔ 🎨)
Example: Red’s new adventure (Pokémon Special)
Plan:
You write or prompt a little bit of text.
The AI generates a whole new story (like a new manga arc).
Then create manga images for scenes of the new story.
This way, you create both the new story and the manga art.

🌟 Summary
Style	Main Work	What You Create
1. Novel ➔ Manga Images	Generate manga art from an existing novel	Only images (story already exists)
2. Text ➔ Manga Story ➔ Manga Images	Create new story and manga art	New story + new images
🛠 My Suggestion

👉 We do Part 1 first (Novel ➔ Manga Images).
It's simpler.
You learn how text ➔ image generation works.
You get cool results faster.
You will feel happy and motivated.

👉 Then later move to Part 2 (Create New Story + Images).
After you're stronger.
After you understand how the system works.

📋 Next Step
If you agree, we will:
Choose a small novel scene (~2–5 sentences).
Prepare a simple text-to-image AI pipeline.
Try to create the first manga-like image!
